Graceful degredation is the design process in software engineering that focuses the ability of a system to maintain basic functionality if older browsers do not support the current functionality of the website. As the lab instructions describe, we handle lower levels with "grace" evem if we start with max technology. Service workers are scripts that run in the bacgrkound of web applications that acts as proxy servers between the web application, browser, and the network. They are closely related since they both are meant to improve the reliability of web development and increase user experience. Graceful degredation ensures if certain features of the site fail, the core functionality of the site works. Service workers ensure the site is resiliant by caching resources and allowing offline functionality. As described in the lab instructions, service workers are tools that help make the sites less network dependent so it does not have to rely on internet connection. Based on what each does, service workers allows for graceful degradation to keep the basic functionality of the site when offline.
